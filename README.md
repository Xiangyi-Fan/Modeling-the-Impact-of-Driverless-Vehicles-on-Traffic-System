# Modeling-the-Impact-of-Driverless-Vehicles-on-Traffic-System
Obtained the optimal ratio of the number of driverless cars to regular cars in D.C. to achieve the optimal traffic flow operation. Simulated this traffic system based on Stochastic User Equilibrium (SUE) model and Cellular Automata Model in MATLAB. Achieved Honorable Mention in the International Mathematical Contest in Modeling.
